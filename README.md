# Tackling Prevalent Conditions in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization

Source code for the ICML'24 paper **Tackling Prevalent Conditions in Unsupervised Combinatorial Optimization: Cardinality, Minimum, Covering, and More**, where we study and propose <strong><span style="font-variant: small-caps;">UCom2</span></strong> (<ins><strong>U</strong></ins>nsupervised <ins><strong>Com</strong></ins>binatorial Optimization <ins><strong>U</strong></ins>nder <ins><strong>Com</strong></ins>monly-involved Conditions).

The "facility_location_and_max_cover" folder contains the code for the experiments on facility location and maximum coverage.

The "robust_coloring" folder contains the code for the experiments on robust coloring.

Please check the train_cmd.txt file in each folder for the guidance for the experiments on each problem.
